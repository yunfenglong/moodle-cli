# moodle-cli

**Give your AI agent access to Moodle.**

Let it keep up with deadlines and grades, fetch course files, and search forum discussions. `moodle-cli` finds your active browser session and keeps it alive in the background, so Moodle's login wall stays out of your way.

## For users

### Start with your agent

Paste this into Codex, Claude Code, OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, or another agent that can use your terminal:

```text
Can you use https://github.com/bunizao/moodle-cli/raw/main/ONBOARDING.md to help me set up moodle-cli?
```

Your agent asks for your Moodle URL and opens your university's sign-in page when needed. Finish SSO in the browser while the agent waits; it verifies your account and sets up session renewal before reading Moodle. The same onboarding can deploy a private remote MCP server through your Cloudflare account.

### Install and sign in manually

For macOS arm64 or Linux x64, install the standalone binary with its bundled runtime:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bunizao/moodle-cli/main/install.sh | sh
moodle doctor
```

Or use Node.js 22.13+ (for SQLite browser stores) or Bun:

```bash
# npm
npm install -g moodle-cli

# Bun
bun add --global moodle-cli

moodle --version
```

Run without a global install:

```bash
npx moodle-cli --help
bunx --bun moodle-cli --help
```

Sign in and open your dashboard:

```bash
moodle auth login
moodle
```

On first use, enter your Moodle site origin, such as `https://moodle.example.edu`. `moodle-cli` validates it and saves it to `~/.config/moodle-cli/config.yaml`. If the CLI cannot find an active session, it opens your university's sign-in page and waits for you to finish.

On macOS the cookie store sits behind Full Disk Access, which is granted to your terminal application rather than to the CLI. If `moodle doctor` reports that the store cannot be opened, either grant that access and restart the terminal, or hand the cookie over once:

```bash
moodle auth login --paste
```

The prompt does not echo, and the value is kept in the encrypted session cache, so this is a one-time step. Paste whatever the browser gives you: in the developer tools' Network tab, `Copy as cURL` on any request to the site carries the cookie, as does the `MoodleSession` value from the cookie panel.

Keep the session active on macOS with `moodle auth keepalive install`. On Linux, schedule `moodle auth keepalive --json` every 30 minutes with cron.

GitHub Releases also provide standalone binaries for macOS arm64 and Linux x64.

### Study Boooooooooost

Ask your agent in plain language or run the matching command:

| Student request | CLI command |
| --- | --- |
| “Give me a quick Moodle dashboard.” | `moodle` |
| “What is due in the next 14 days?” | `moodle due --days 14` |
| “Show my grades and feedback for UNIT.” | `moodle grades UNIT` |
| “Find forum posts about the exam in UNIT.” | `moodle forums search "exam" --course UNIT` |
| “Download the slides from this Moodle link.” | `moodle download '<Moodle URL>' --dest './slides.pdf'` |

Unit arguments accept the site's code or name, an id or URL. No code format is assumed.

```bash
moodle UNIT
moodle UNIT 7
moodle UNIT "TASK"
moodle find "week 7 slides" UNIT
moodle dl "UNIT week 7 slides" --to ./downloads
moodle grades
moodle news UNIT
```

Ambiguous references list candidates. JSON callers receive `error.code: "ambiguous"`;
At a terminal you pick the match from a list (arrow keys, or type to filter a long one). A bare number in a section reference matches
that number in the site's section name, so 7 never matches 17.

#### Paste Moodle links directly

The CLI recognizes course, forum, assignment, quiz, resource, page, folder, and grade-report URLs:

```bash
moodle 'https://moodle.example.edu/course/view.php?id=34637'
moodle 'https://moodle.example.edu/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=9001#p9101'
moodle download 'https://moodle.example.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=91234' --dest './Week 03/slides.pdf'
```

You can paste the same links into your agent and ask it to inspect the page, find related material, or download the file.

#### Download course files

`moodle download` (alias `dl`) saves what the web page offers:

- one activity: a resource, every file in a folder, or an assignment's attached files (brief, datasets);
- a whole section: `moodle dl "UNIT week 5"` or a section URL such as `…/course/view.php?id=34637&section=5`, including child sections the page shows inside it;
- a single `pluginfile.php` link.

With no argument at a terminal, it walks unit → section → item the way the course page does: type to filter, Escape to go back a step. `moodle dl UNIT` starts at that unit's sections. Files land in the current directory or `--to DIR` (created when missing). A file already there is skipped, so rerunning a section after Ctrl+C or a dropped connection fetches only what is missing; `--force` downloads everything again. The same document linked twice is saved once, and two different files with one name get a ` (2)` suffix. `--dest` names the file when there is exactly one. Quote URLs in zsh, whose `?` is a glob.

#### Submit assignment files

`moodle submit` uploads local files into an assignment through the same pages a browser
uses, then prints the receipt Moodle shows afterwards: status, files, due date and the
time it was checked. It is the only command that writes to Moodle.

```bash
moodle submit "UNIT TASK" essay.pdf --dry-run          # plan only: limits, statement, existing files
moodle submit "UNIT TASK" essay.pdf                    # upload as a draft; refused if the assignment has no draft stage
moodle submit "UNIT TASK" --final --accept-statement   # submit the draft for grading (cannot be undone)
```

Every run plans first and asks for confirmation; `--yes` skips the prompt for scripts.
`--replace` removes the files already in the submission, `--accept-statement` agrees to
the site's submission statement when one is required, and a file that is too large or of
the wrong type is refused before anything is uploaded. Some assignments have no draft
stage, so saving the files is the submission for grading; without `--final`, `submit`
refuses those (and any assignment whose pages do not show which kind it is) before
uploading anything. The plan reports `draft_stage`. `--replace` with no files is refused
rather than emptying the submission. In a group submission the plan names the `group`:
its files are shared, so an upload or `--replace` changes everyone's submission. When every
member has to submit, the receipt lists who Moodle is still `awaiting`.

### Take a quiz (beta)

`moodle quiz` starts an attempt, saves answers and submits it, replaying the forms a browser posts. It is beta: a Moodle update can break it, and it is deliberately CLI-only, never offered over MCP.

```bash
moodle quiz start UNIT "Practice quiz"        # or a quiz id or URL; resumes an attempt in progress
moodle quiz show <attempt> <quiz> --page 2
moodle quiz answer <attempt> <quiz> 1 b         # option letter, or "a,c" for several
moodle quiz answer <attempt> <quiz> 3 --from essay.md
moodle quiz finish <attempt> <quiz>             # "Submit all and finish"; Moodle does not allow undoing this
```

Before `quiz start` asks, it names the time limit (the timer starts at once and does not pause) and how many attempts are left. A quiz that moves forward only is refused an earlier page, and `quiz show --page` asks before opening the next page, because that locks the current one. Every write shows the beta and academic-integrity notice and asks for a yes; a pipe must pass `--yes`, and `--dry-run` shows the plan. Answers you send are your own submission under your institution's rules: use it only where the quiz allows it, and check the attempt in a browser before you finish. A quiz with an access password asks for it at the terminal (not echoed, never stored); scripts pass `--password`. A quiz that requires the Safe Exam Browser cannot be taken here, because Moodle checks the browser itself. Question types without a plain choice or text input are shown but must be answered in a browser.

### Remote MCP for web AI

A private remote MCP server lets a supported web AI client use Moodle when it cannot run the local CLI. You need a Cloudflare account.

```bash
moodle mcp deploy
moodle mcp status
```

`moodle mcp deploy` validates Moodle access, deploys a Cloudflare Worker, uploads an encrypted Moodle session, verifies readiness, and installs session renewal. The guided [`ONBOARDING.md`](ONBOARDING.md) asks whether you want this after local setup and helps connect your web AI client.

The MCP `get_file` tool accepts a resource activity ID, resource URL, or `pluginfile.php` URL and returns files up to 16 MiB directly as an embedded MCP resource. The Moodle session stays inside the local server or private Worker; clients do not need to fetch an authenticated Moodle URL themselves.

The remote server is read-only. The local server (`moodle mcp serve`) also offers `submit`, which needs the files on the same machine. It defaults to `dry_run: true`, so an agent has to show the plan and run it again with `dry_run: false` to upload; `final: true` submits for grading.

### Update

```bash
moodle update
```

`moodle update` upgrades the package with whichever installer put it there (npm, bun, or the standalone binary replacing itself), then runs `moodle mcp deploy` when a managed Worker exists and is behind the new release. `moodle update --check` only reports versions.

The CLI checks npm once a day in the background and prints a one-line notice on stderr when a newer release exists. A deployed Worker performs the same daily check and tells connected MCP clients through the server instructions, because the Worker ships inside the package and only redeploys from your machine. Set `MOODLE_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to disable the check; it is already off under `CI`.

## For developers and agents

### Command and output contract

Inspect the full machine-readable command tree:

```bash
moodle commands --json
```

Commands support:

- `--json` or `--yaml` for structured output; `--pretty` indents JSON
- `--table` for human-readable output
- `--fields units,total` to select envelope fields
- `-o, --output FILE` to write command output or a download receipt

The CLI prints tables in an interactive terminal and JSON when stdout goes to a pipe or file. In a terminal, a command missing its unit asks for it with a picker (`moodle activities` lists your units); pipes, `--json` and agent shells get the usage error with the usage line instead. Structured errors use one JSON object on stderr:

```json
{"ok":false,"error":{"code":"auth","message":"...","hint":"..."},"exit_code":3}
```

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Network, configuration, or unexpected error |
| 2 | Usage error |
| 3 | Authentication error |
| 4 | Course, activity, forum, or discussion not found |
| 5 | Moodle rejected the request |

### Agent skill

Install the generated skill bundle:

```bash
moodle skills add

# Direct alternatives
npx skills add https://github.com/bunizao/moodle-cli
bunx --bun skills add https://github.com/bunizao/moodle-cli
```

[`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) routes agents to focused setup, coursework, forum, download, and maintenance guidance under [`references/`](references/).

### MCP lifecycle and protocol

```bash
moodle mcp deploy
moodle mcp status
moodle mcp login
moodle mcp connect
moodle mcp pair
moodle mcp remove
moodle mcp serve
moodle mcp bridge
```

The default client connection uses `moodle mcp bridge`, which keeps the Bearer token out of client configuration. Use `moodle mcp connect CLIENT --mode remote` for clients that support authenticated remote MCP headers.

### Connect claude.ai

claude.ai custom connectors authenticate with OAuth, so the deployed Worker is also a single-user OAuth 2.1 authorization server. Nothing is approved until you open a pairing window from your own computer:

```bash
moodle mcp pair
```

The command prints the connector URL and a one-time pairing code that is valid for ten minutes and one approval. Add the URL as a custom connector in Claude, sign in when Claude opens the approval page, and enter the code. Claude then keeps a rotating OAuth token instead of your Bearer token, and `/authorize` refuses every request while no pairing window is open.

Version `0.7.0` supports MCP `2026-07-28`, a stateless compatibility lane for `2025-11-25`, and the `2025-06-18` and `2025-03-26` revisions that current hosted clients negotiate.

### Configuration

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `MOODLE_BASE_URL` | Set the Moodle site origin without writing a config file. |
| `MOODLE_CONFIG` | Use another YAML config file. |
| `MOODLE_TOKEN` | Provide a `MoodleSession` cookie value in a non-browser environment. |
| `MOODLE_SESSION` | Compatibility alias for `MOODLE_TOKEN`. |

For local use, save `base_url` in `~/.config/moodle-cli/config.yaml`. `MOODLE_URL` remains a deprecated fallback for `MOODLE_BASE_URL`.

### Private MCP operations

Each Worker is pinned to one Moodle account. Uploads for a different account are rejected; use a separate deployment for that account. Session cookies, sesskeys and account metadata are encrypted together. Existing remote records and local caches migrate when read. Local cache encryption keys and deployment credentials require OS-protected storage (Windows also supports DPAPI); macOS/Linux no longer silently create plaintext credential files. `--no-cache` bypasses cache reads and writes.

```bash
moodle mcp clients --json
moodle mcp revoke CLIENT_ID
moodle mcp revoke --all
moodle --yes mcp deploy --rotate-token
moodle --yes mcp deploy --rotate-key
moodle --yes mcp deploy --repair
```

The initial upgrade invalidates old OAuth grants; run `moodle mcp pair` again for hosted clients. Revocation closes pending authorizations and pairing windows as well as tokens. Token rotation immediately invalidates old static credentials and OAuth grants; local bridge configurations resolve the new token automatically. Native remote header clients must receive the new token. Key rotation migrates the active encrypted record, verifies it, then removes the previous key from the active configuration.

Deployment uses Cloudflare's atomic code/secrets operation, including Durable Object migrations. An update first verifies a compatible recovery release that supports the owner's static bridge; OAuth is temporarily unavailable in recovery mode. Rollback checks session schema, encryption-key identity and credential identity. It will not activate an incompatible pre-migration version or restore revoked credentials. `--repair` reconciles the live session revision after interrupted uploads.

Pending OAuth registrations expire after ten minutes and can be reclaimed without evicting approved clients. The approved client limit is 20. Credential-bearing requests have bounded redirects and timeouts; foreign redirect destinations never receive the Moodle cookie. Worker request bodies are limited to 64 KiB. Managed deployment disables request observability by default to avoid retaining authentication form bodies or query data in logs.

## Installation footprint and removal

| Install path | Files left locally |
| --- | --- |
| Installer | `~/.local/bin/moodle`; configuration and cache after first use |
| Manual binary | The chosen executable; configuration and cache after first use |
| npm global | npm global package/bin; configuration and cache after first use |
| Bun global | Bun global package/bin; configuration and cache after first use |
| npx | npm execution cache; configuration and cache after first use |
| bunx | Bun execution cache; configuration and cache after first use |

The CLI, local MCP server and bridge do not install Wrangler. Cloudflare management
uses Wrangler on PATH, or downloads the pinned version into
`~/.config/moodle-cli/tools/wrangler@VERSION`. A binary install needs Bun or Node/npm
only when managing Cloudflare. Worker payloads are included in the binary.
Background jobs are opt-in: keepalive and managed MCP renewal.

`moodle uninstall --dry-run` previews cleanup. `moodle uninstall` removes local jobs;
`--remote` also removes the selected Worker; `--purge` removes local configuration/cache
after deployments have been removed. Finish with `npm rm -g moodle-cli`,
`bun remove -g moodle-cli`, or removal of the standalone executable. Package-manager
execution caches are managed by npm/Bun themselves.

## 0.8 structured output migration

CLI JSON and MCP use compact envelopes: `units`, `unit` plus `sections`, `due`, `item`,
`grades`, `news`, `thread`, `results`, or `file`. Empty strings and lists are omitted;
`total: 0` identifies an empty result. List rows use `type`, `unit_id`, `section_id`
and `name`. Dates include ISO offsets and epoch seconds. Unit detail defaults to a
section index; pass a section for activities. `--fields` selects envelope keys.

The 11 default MCP tools are home, due, units, unit, find, item, grades, news, thread,
search_forums and file; a local server adds submit, whose `submission` envelope is the
upload receipt. Old names remain callable through 0.8 with the new envelopes;
they are deprecated and omitted from default discovery to avoid duplicate catalog cost.
The local command tree remains available, including courses as an alias for units.
The unused projects/quiet aliases were removed. `--verbose` (`-v`) prints sanitized
request paths and timing; it never logs URL queries or credentials.

Run `npm run measure:mcp` to reproduce fixture payload measurements. See
[implementation evidence](docs/plans/optimization-implementation.md) for live checks,
measurement scope and remaining budget differences.
