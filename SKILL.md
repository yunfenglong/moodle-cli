# Moodle CLI

Reads Moodle; only `submit` writes. UNIT is a site code/name, id or URL; SECTION is a number or name.
Never assume code patterns or ask for ids; `moodle units` shows the vocabulary.

| Intent | Run |
| --- | --- |
| dashboard | moodle |
| deadlines | moodle due [UNIT] --days 14 |
| unit names | moodle units |
| a unit or section | moodle UNIT [SECTION] |
| find slides or a task | moodle find "QUERY" [UNIT] |
| submission or item detail | moodle UNIT "TASK" |
| a quiz attempt | moodle attempt ID |
| my grades | moodle grades [UNIT] |
| announcements | moodle news [UNIT] |
| forum post text | moodle forums search "QUERY" --unit UNIT |
| upload assignment files | moodle submit "UNIT TASK" FILE... [--final] |
| download a file | moodle dl "UNIT TASK" --to DIR |

Pipes emit compact JSON; `--json` forces it, `--pretty` indents it.
Ambiguity returns `candidates`: pick or refine, never guess.
Lists report `total`; narrow or page when more exist. Quote ISO dates.
Never expose cookies or tokens. Download or submit only when asked; dry-run submit first. `--final` cannot be undone.
Sign-in trouble: `moodle doctor`; remote expiry: `moodle mcp login`.
Exact syntax: `moodle commands --json` or [reference](references/command-reference.md).
Setup, MCP and removal: [guide](references/setup-and-auth.md).
